README for COMP 40 HW8
Assembly-Language Programming: An RPN Calculator
Dakota LeRoy and Chan Hiu Ki
12/9/16

1. Acknowledgements: Dakota LeRoy and Chan Hiu Ki have shared
this assignment and have received assistance on these programs from several 
excellent comp40 teaching assistants. Additionally, some sample code and
most of the structure has been provided for us in the specification.

2. Working Correctly/Incorrectly:
From our testing, we believe our RPN calculator works and supports all
commands correctly.

3. Depatures from Recommended Calling Convention:
Our program follows the recommended calling convention and design except
that our waiting state is a separate label called by main rather than in
callmain, and we implemented the call stack and value stack separately
rather than as a single stack.

4. Print Module:
Our program's print module recursively calls the print label to traverse
through the entire stack, where the print label calls separate recursive
labels in our printd.ums file to traverse through each individual number
on the stack.

5. Time Spent: 
We worked for approximately 9 hours analyzing, 5 hours writing assembly
code, and approximately 4 hours debugging.
